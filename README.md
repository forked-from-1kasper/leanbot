# Requirements

I use Lean version 3.3.1, commit 28f4143be31b. On older versions of Lean (release 3.3.0) this will not work because of changes in system.io.

Also need `netcat`. You can try to configure the start using telnet, but I do not guarantee the functionality.

I designed and tested this on Fedora Linux 27. On macOS, this should also work, because this is also a UNIX-like system. On Windows, you can try using cygwin.

If you want to edit the source code in GNU Emacs, Visual Studio Code, or another editor, the repository directory must be in `LEAN_PATH`.
